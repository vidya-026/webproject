        <h2>"The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green 
            thing which stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not
             regulate my propositions. And some see no nature at all.
             But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself." â€“William Blake</h2>
